# BestPlayerInTheTeam
Another project made for GCI

The program will hunt for data in files DataX.ods where x ranges from 0 to 9, IELTS.ods and Interview.ods. If only Data7.ods is present, for instance, the program will still be able to read that file.

Next it will get Math and Physics score from the Data file set and adds it along with other scores with Math and Physics twice the relevance.

Similarly, from Ielts one, four equally valued results and from Interview, 5 equally valued results are added along.

Finally, it rearranges the values and names with highest scorer at the top and the lowest at bottom.
